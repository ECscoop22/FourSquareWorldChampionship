      <p><strong>The rules below represent the official standards used at the Four Square World Championships, held annually in Bridgton, Maine.</strong> While Four Square is played around the world with many different rule variations, this rulebook specifically governs the gameplay, court layout, and tournament structure for the World Championship.</p>
      <p>For those interested in alternate styles or playground adaptations, we invite you to explore the <a href="#other-rules">"Other Rules"</a> section at the bottom of this page.</p>

    <div class="rule-block">
      <h2>Court Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Game is played on a square court divided into four equal quadrants.</li>
        <li>Each quadrant is assigned a rank: 1 (King), 2, 3, and 4 (lowest).</li>
        <li>Boundary lines are considered in.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-block">
      <h2>Serving Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Game begins with the player in square 1 serving to square 2.</li>
        <li>Serve must be underhand and hit once into the server’s own square before crossing into the receiver’s square.</li>
        <li>Receiver must allow the ball to bounce once before returning it.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-block">
      <h2>Ball Striking Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Only hands and wrists may strike the ball. “Hands” are defined as the area from the wrist to the fingertips, including the backs of the hands.</li>
        <li>The ball may be struck with one or both hands, using either open palms or closed fists, as long as it is one deliberate and clean hit.</li>
        <li>No carrying, catching, holding, or double-hits (hitting the ball twice in a row) are allowed at any time.</li>
        <li>Unnatural spins are permitted only if the spin is the result of a single legal strike—not a carry or scoop.</li>
        <li>Any player who strikes the ball illegally is considered out for that round.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-block">
      <h2>Faults & Eliminations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If the ball bounces twice in a player's square, they are out.</li>
        <li>If a player hits the ball out of bounds, they are out.</li>
        <li>Interference with another player’s space is grounds for elimination.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-block">
      <h2>Advancement</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>When a player is eliminated, the remaining players advance to fill the vacated squares in order of rank.</li>
        <li>A new player joins in square 4.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-block">
      <h2>Other Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Variations may exist in casual or playground settings, such as using feet, playing with more than four squares, or modifying serve rules.</li>
        <li>These variations are not part of the official World Championship rules but may be enjoyed recreationally.</li>
      </ul>
