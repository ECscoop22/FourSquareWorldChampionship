      <h2 class="section-header red">📜 Introduction</h2>
      <div class="rule-intro">
  <p><strong>The rules below represent the official standards used at the Four Square World Championships, held annually in Bridgton, Maine.</strong> While Four Square is played around the world with many different rule variations, this rulebook specifically governs the gameplay, court layout, and tournament structure for the World Championship.</p>
  <p>For those interested in alternate styles or playground adaptations, we invite you to explore the <a href="#other-rules">"Other Rules"</a> section at the bottom of this page.</p>
</div>

    <section class="card dark fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-header teal">🏐 Equipment</h2>
      <p><strong>Ball:</strong> An 8.5-inch rubber playground ball inflated to 2 lbs.</p>
 <ul>
    <li>Four Square requires minimal equipment, making it easy to play almost anywhere.</li>
    <li>Games can take place on any flat surface—chalk-drawn courts, taped-off indoor/outdoor floors, or professionally painted courts.</li>
    <li>Any ball that reliably bounces can be used, though a standard playground ball (8.5-inch rubber) is typically preferred for consistency and control.</li>
  </ul>      
    </section>

    <section class="card light fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-header orange">🟦 Court Specifications</h2>
      <p>Dimensions: A 16 x 16-foot square divided into four equal 8 x 8-foot squares, numbered 1–4 with 4 and 1 diagonal from each other.</p>
      <img src="images/court layout.png" alt="Four Square Court Layout" class="fade-in" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;" />
      <p><strong>Lines:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>All court lines are 1 inch wide.</li>
        <li>Outside lines are in-bounds; a ball landing on these remains in play.</li>
        <li>Inside lines (dividing squares) are out-of-bounds.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card dark fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-header blue">🚫 Out-of-Play Zone</h2>
      <p>To balance overhand and closed-fist strikes, the Out-of-Play Zone discourages unreturnable shots:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A 10-foot zone beyond each court boundary.</li>
        <li>If a ball lands here after a legal hit, the striker is out.</li>
        <li>The out-of-play zone line is in-play.</li>
        <li>Used in the Championship Round based on venue/house rules.</li>
      </ul>
