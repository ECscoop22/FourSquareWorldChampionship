      <h2 class="section-header red">📜 Introduction</h2>
      <div class="rule-intro">
  <p><strong>The rules below represent the official standards used at the Four Square World Championships, held annually in Bridgton, Maine.</strong> While Four Square is played around the world with many different rule variations, this rulebook specifically governs the gameplay, court layout, and tournament structure for the World Championship.</p>
  <p>For those interested in alternate styles or playground adaptations, we invite you to explore the <a href="#other-rules">"Other Rules"</a> section at the bottom of this page.</p>
</div>

    <section class="card dark fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-header teal">🏐 Equipment</h2>
      <p><strong>Ball:</strong> An 8.5-inch rubber playground ball inflated to 2 lbs.</p>
 <ul>
    <li>Four Square requires minimal equipment, making it easy to play almost anywhere.</li>
    <li>Games can take place on any flat surface—chalk-drawn courts, taped-off indoor/outdoor floors, or professionally painted courts.</li>
    <li>Any ball that reliably bounces can be used, though a standard playground ball (8.5-inch rubber) is typically preferred for consistency and control.</li>
  </ul>      
    </section>

    <section class="card light fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-header orange">🟦 Court Specifications</h2>
      <p>Dimensions: A 16 x 16-foot square divided into four equal 8 x 8-foot squares, numbered 1–4 with 4 and 1 diagonal from each other.</p>
      <img src="images/court layout.png" alt="Four Square Court Layout" class="fade-in" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;" />
      <p><strong>Lines:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>All court lines are 1 inch wide.</li>
        <li>Outside lines are in-bounds; a ball landing on these remains in play.</li>
        <li>Inside lines (dividing squares) are out-of-bounds; a ball landing on these results in an "out.".</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card dark fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-header blue">🚫 Out-of-Play Zone</h2>
      <p>To ensure fairness and promote returnable gameplay, and since overhand and closed-fist strikes are allowed where some four square rules allow only underhand hits, an Out-of-Play Zone is used to discourage unreturnable shots.
<li>The Out-of-Play Zone is a clearly marked square, extending 10 feet beyond each boundary line of the Four Square court.<li>
<li>If a ball is legally hit into another player’s square and then bounces and lands into the Out-of-Play Zone, the player who struck the ball is out.<li>
 <li>The out-of-play zone line is in-play.</li>
        <li>This rule is designed to encourage all hits to maintain a level of reasonable and possible returnability. This also encourages safety for competitors and spectators.<li>
<li>May only be used during the Championship Round, depending on venue or house regulations.<li>
</p>

      <h2 class="section-header red">🎯 Objective</h2>
      <p>Be the last player standing! The goal is to be the last player remaining after all other players have been eliminated.
When play begins, each square contains a player along with the players waiting in line. The player in square 4 serves the ball to square 1 who then hits the ball into a square other than their own. The hits go on until someone gets “out”.

    <section class="card dark fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-header teal">👣 Player Positioning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Square 4 serves to Square 1.</li>
        <li>Players may move freely as long as they don't commit interference.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card light fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-header orange">📤 Serving the Ball</h2>
      <ul>
    <li>The server (player in Square 4) must stand within six inches of the back corner if an adult, or within one foot if a child.</li>
    <li>The ball must be bounced once in the server’s own square, then struck with one or both hands into Square 1.</li>
    <li>The serve must be controlled and non-aggressive, with standard rotation, and may not rise above the receiving player’s head height at any point.</li>
    <li>The receiving player in Square 1 is allowed one do-over per round by calling “one bad.”</li>
    <li>If the serve is illegal—such as landing outside Square 1 or hitting an internal line—the server is out.</li>
  </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card dark fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-header blue">✋ Ball Striking Rules</h2>
      <ul>
  <li>Only hands and wrists may strike the ball. “Hands” are defined as the area from the wrist to the fingertips, including the backs of the hands.</li>
  <li>The ball may be struck with one or both hands, using either open palms or closed fists, as long as it is one deliberate and clean hit.</li>
  <li>No carrying, catching, holding, or double-hits are allowed at any time.</li>
  <li>Other then the serve, spinning the ball is allowed as long as the hit that produces the spin is not a carry or other illegal hit.</li>
  <li>Kids' divisions require a bounce before hitting.</li>
  <li>Any player who strikes the ball illegally is considered out.</li>

</ul>

    <section class="card light fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-header red">🙅 Interference & Poaching</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Once the ball bounces in a square, only that player may hit it.<li>
          <li>If the ball bounces in a square and another player makes contact with the ball (deliberately or not), and the player whose square the ball bounced in makes an attempt to play the ball and had a realistic chance of getting it, the player who made contact with the ball is out.<li>
<li>If the player whose square the ball bounced in does not make a legitimate attempt to play the ball and another player makes contact with the ball (deliberate or not), the player whose square the ball bounced in is “out”.<li>
<li>Boys + Girls/Children’s Divisions: The ball must bounce in a square for a player to hit the ball (no air balls).<li> 
<li>Players are not able to physically impede another player from the ball. Impeding another player from getting the ball is another form of “interference” and results in an out.<li>

      </ul>

    <section class="card dark fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-header teal">❌ Elimination (Out)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Letting the ball bounce twice.</li>
        <li>Hitting it out-of-bounds, the inside lines or the out-of-play zone.</li>
        <li>Carrying, poaching, interfering.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card light fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-header orange">🏟️ Court Environment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Depending on venue, the ball bouncing off walls = in play.</li>
        <li>If a player had a legit chance and it hits a chair or person: round restarts.</li>
        <li>If no chance to return it: player is out.</li>
