      <div class="rule-intro">
  <p><strong>The rules below represent the official standards used at the <a href="world-championship.html">Four Square World Championships</a>, held annually in Bridgton, Maine.</strong>
  <p>For those interested in alternate styles or playground adaptations, we invite you to explore the <a href="#other-rules">"Other Rules"</a> section at the bottom of this page.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header teal">🏐 Equipment</h2>
      <p><strong>Ball:</strong> An 8.5-inch rubber playground ball inflated to 2 lbs.</p>
 <ul>
    <li>Four Square requires minimal equipment, making it easy to play almost anywhere.</li>
    <li>Games can take place on any flat surface—chalk-drawn courts, taped-off indoor/outdoor floors, or professionally painted courts.</li>
    <li>Any ball that reliably bounces can be used, though a standard playground ball (8.5-inch rubber) is typically preferred for consistency and control.</li>
  </ul>      
    </section>

    <section class="card light fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-header orange">🟦 Court Specifications</h2>
      <p>Dimensions: A 16 x 16-foot square divided into four equal 8 x 8-foot squares, numbered 1–4 with 4 and 1 diagonal from each other.</p>
      <img src="images/court layout.png" alt="Four Square Court Layout" class="fade-in" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;" />
      <p><strong>Lines:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>All court lines are 1 inch wide.</li>
        <li>Outside lines are in-bounds; a ball landing on these remains in play.</li>
        <li>Inside lines (dividing squares) are out-of-bounds; a ball landing on these results in an "out.".</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card dark fade-in">
  <h2 class="section-header blue">🚫 Out-of-Play Zone</h2>
  <p>
    To ensure fairness and promote returnable gameplay—and since overhand and closed-fist strikes are allowed where some Four Square rules allow only underhand hits—an Out-of-Play Zone is used to discourage unreturnable shots.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Out-of-Play Zone is a clearly marked square, extending 10 feet beyond each boundary line of the Four Square court.</li>
    <li>If a ball is legally hit into another player’s square and then bounces and lands into the Out-of-Play Zone, the player who struck the ball is out.</li>
    <li>The out-of-play zone line is in-play.</li>
    <li>This rule is designed to encourage all hits to maintain a level of reasonable and possible returnability. This also encourages safety for competitors and spectators.</li>
    <li>May only be used during the Championship Round, depending on venue or house regulations.</li>
  </ul>

      <h2 class="section-header red">🎯 Objective</h2>
      <p>Be the last player standing! The goal is to be the last player remaining after all other players have been eliminated.
When play begins, each square contains a player along with the players waiting in line. The player in square 4 serves the ball to square 1 who then hits the ball into a square other than their own. The hits go on until someone gets “out”.

    <section class="card dark fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-header blue">✋ Ball Striking Rules</h2>
      <ul>
  <li>Only hands and wrists may strike the ball. “Hands” are defined as the area from the wrist to the fingertips, including the backs of the hands.</li>
  <li>The ball may be struck with one or both hands, using either open palms or closed fists, as long as it is one deliberate and clean hit.</li>
  <li>No carrying, catching, holding, or double-hits are allowed at any time.</li>
  <li>Other then the serve, spinning the ball is allowed as long as the hit that produces the spin is not a carry or other illegal hit.</li>
  <li>Kids' divisions require a bounce before hitting (no air balls).</li>
  <li>Any player who strikes the ball illegally is considered out.</li>

</ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card light fade-in">
  <h2 class="section-header red">🙅 Interference & Poaching</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Once the ball bounces in a square, only that player may hit it.</li>
    <li>If the ball bounces in a square and another player makes contact with the ball (deliberately or not), and the player whose square the ball bounced in makes an attempt to play the ball and had a realistic chance of getting it, the player who made contact with the ball is out.</li>
    <li>If the player whose square the ball bounced in does not make a legitimate attempt to play the ball and another player makes contact with the ball (deliberate or not), the player whose square the ball bounced in is “out”.</li>
    <li>Boys + Girls/Children’s Divisions: The ball must bounce in a square for a player to hit the ball (no air balls).</li>
    <li>Players are not able to physically impede another player from the ball. Impeding another player from getting the ball is another form of “interference” and results in an out.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

    <section class="card dark fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-header teal">❌ Elimination (Out)</h2>
      <p>Each time a player is out, that player leaves the court and enters the line and, if applicable, all players advance to the higher numbered square. Square 1 is then filled with a new player.</p>
      <ul>
     <p style="margin-left: -20px;"><strong>Ways to get out:</strong></p>
        <li>Ball bounces more than once in your square.</li>
        <li>Hitting the ball out-of-bounds, the inside lines, your own square or the out-of-play zone.</li>
        <li>Carrying, poaching, interfering.</li>
        <li>Ball hits you not in hands.</li>

   <section class="card">
  <h2 class="section-header red">🏟️ Court Environment</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If the ball <strong>bounces in a square and then strikes a wall</strong>, play continues.</li>
    <li>
      If the ball <strong>bounces in a square</strong> and an <strong>obstacle impedes the player</strong> from returning the ball (e.g., person, chair, object):
      <ul>
        <li>If the player <strong>made an attempt</strong> and <strong>had a realistic chance</strong> of legally returning the ball, the round is declared <strong>“dead”</strong> and will <strong>restart</strong>.</li>
        <li>If the player <strong>did not attempt</strong> or <strong>had no realistic chance</strong> of returning the ball, that player is <strong>out</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

    <li>If this scenario happens <strong>again in the same round with the same two players</strong>, a <strong>showdown</strong> occurs.</li>
    <li>If it happens again <strong>in the same round but with different players</strong>, the round is declared <strong>dead</strong> and will restart.</li>
    <li><strong>Maximum of two “do-overs”</strong> per round for this scenario. If it occurs a <strong>third time</strong>, <em>regardless of which players are involved</em>, a <strong>showdown</strong> will occur.</li>

  </button>
  <div id="otherRulesContent" style="display: none; margin-top: 15px;">
    <p>While the rules above reflect the standards used at the Four Square World Championships, we recognize that many versions of the game exist. These “Other Rules” are accounted for below.</p>
    
    <p>These variations are popular in schools, local tournaments, and backyard play. While some of these are not used at the World Championships, they reflect the creativity and fun of the game!</p>

  <p><strong>Points Per Serve</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>In competitive games, the player in Square 4 earns 1 point per successful serve.</li>
    <li>At the end of a timed game, the player with the most points wins.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Just for Fun</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Many Four Square games—especially among children—are played recreationally, without tracking points or determining a winner.</li>
    <li>These games can still be competitive but emphasize fun and participation over outcomes.</li>
  </ul>

  ➕ Equipment
</button>
<div id="otherEquipmentContent" style="display: none; margin-top: 10px;">
  <p><strong>Ball Type</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use any ball that bounces well.</li>
    <li><strong>Preferred:</strong> Four Square ball.</li>
    <li><strong>Acceptable alternatives:</strong> volleyball, basketball, soccer ball, tennis ball, etc.</li>
    <li>The ball should rebound to at least 50% of the height from which it was dropped.</li>

<button class="collapsible-toggle" onclick="toggleOtherCourtSpecs()" style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: bold; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: none; padding: 8px 16px; width: 100%; text-align: left; cursor: pointer; border-radius: 4px; margin-top: 20px;">
  ➕ Court Specifications
</button>
<div id="otherCourtSpecsContent" style="display: none; margin-top: 10px;">
  <p><strong>Court Size</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Standard recreational courts:</strong> 10' x 10' (divided into four 5' x 5' squares).</li>
    <li><strong>World Championship courts:</strong> 16' x 16' (divided into four 8' x 8' squares).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Court Setup</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Requires only a flat surface, a ball, and at least 2 players.</li>
    <li>Temporary courts can be marked with chalk or tape; permanent ones may be painted.</li>
    <li>Common surfaces: asphalt, concrete, gym floors, grass, dirt, carpet.</li>
    <li>Common locations: playgrounds, driveways, sidewalks, parking lots, gyms.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Square Designations</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Most common naming system: Numbers (4, 3, 2, 1).</li>
    <li>Alternatives: Letters (A, B, C, D), or titles (King, Queen, Jack, Pawn).</li>
    <li>Some use colors.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Square Orientation</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Recreational courts:</strong> often have Squares 4 and 2 diagonal from each other.</li>
    <li><strong>World Championship format:</strong> Square 4 and 1 are diagonal, with serves required to go to Square 1.</li>
    <li>This setup helps prevent teaming and ensures new players touch the ball.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Line Rules</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>In some games, all lines are out—hitting any line results in an out.</li>
    <li>This is up to house rules.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Out-of-Play Zone</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ideally, courts should have a 10-foot clearance surrounding them.</li>
    <li>This area is referred to as the “out-of-play” zone in competitive settings.</li>
  </ul>

  ➕ Serving the Ball
</button>
<div id="otherServingContent" style="display: none; margin-top: 10px;">
  <p><strong>Serving Styles</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rules vary widely:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Some games have no serving rules.</li>
      <li>Others enforce strict rules: serve with one or two hands, from outside the square, to a specific square, at a certain height, or with a specific spin.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Serve Target</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>In World Championship play, the serve must go to Square 1.</li>
    <li>Other games may allow serves to any square.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>“One Bad” / Do-Overs</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Also called “first serve” or “do-over.”</li>
    <li>Some games allow unlimited retries until a fair serve is made.</li>
    <li>Others limit the number of “bad” serves allowed.</li>

  ➕ Ball Striking
</button>
<div id="otherStrikingContent" style="display: none; margin-top: 10px;">
  <p><strong>Legal Hits</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rules differ by game:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Some allow any kind of hit (overhand, underhand).</li>
      <li>Others ban overhand hits (“palmsies down”) and require underhand only.</li>
      <li>Some allow or prohibit spins (“spinzies”).</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Server's Rule-Setting</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>In casual games, the player in Square 4 may set rules until they are eliminated (e.g., “underhands only,” “no spins”).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Air Balls</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Defined as hitting the ball into another square before it bounces.</li>
    <li>Some games ban air balls entirely.</li>
    <li>Others allow them, except when returning a serve.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
    <!-- Interference & Poaching -->

  ➕ Interference & Poaching
</button>
<div id="otherInterferenceContent" style="display: none; margin-top: 10px;">
  <p><strong>Ball Ownership</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Once a ball bounces in a square, only the occupying player may hit it.</li>
    <li>If another player hits the ball:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>And</strong> the rightful player attempted to play the ball: the interfering player is out.</li>
        <li><strong>If</strong> the rightful player did not attempt to play: the rightful player is out.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Interference Determination</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Situational, especially in recreational games.</li>
    <li>Judgment is made by officials or fellow players in competitive games.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Physical Interference</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Players may not physically impede others from reaching the ball.</li>
    <li>This form of interference typically results in an out.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Air Ball Caution</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Air balls often increase risk of interference due to players crossing into other squares.</li>
    <li>Most games allow this if no interference occurs.</li>
  </ul>

  ➕ Court Environment & House Rules
</button>
<div id="otherEnvironmentContent" style="display: none; margin-top: 10px;">
  <p>Four Square can be played in varied environments, so it’s important to set house rules before playing.</p>
